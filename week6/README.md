# Week 6 – Binary Trees and BSTs

## Overview
This week focuses on:
- Binary Trees: height, symmetry, mirroring, diameter
- Binary Search Trees (BST): construction, inorder successor, kth largest element
- Tree traversal techniques: zigzag, boundary, ancestor printing
- Common tree-related problems and checks

## Exercises

1. Height of Binary Tree → `question-1.py`  
2. Determine if Two Trees Are Identical → `question-2.py`  
3. Mirror Tree → `question-3.py`  
4. Symmetric Tree → `question-4.py`  
5. Check for Balanced Tree → `question-5.py`  
6. Children Sum Parent → `question-6.py`  
7. Array to BST → `question-7.py`  
8. Nodes at Given Distance in a Binary Tree → `question-8.py`  
9. Inorder Successor in BST → `question-9.py`  
10. Kth Largest Element in a BST → `question-10.py`  
11. Diameter of Tree → `question-11.py`  
12. Check if Subtree → `question-12.py`  
13. Check for BST → `question-13.py`  
14. Single Valued Subtree → `question-14.py`  
15. Zigzag Tree Traversal → `question-15.py`  
16. Boundary Traversal → `question-16.py`  
17. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal → `question-17.py`  
18. Construct BST from Preorder Traversal → `question-18.py`  
19. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree → `question-19.py`  
20. Ancestors in Binary Tree → `question-20.py`  

## Running Tests
To run all tests for Week 6, use Python’s `unittest` module:

```bash
cd week-6
python -m unittest discover
